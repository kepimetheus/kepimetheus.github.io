# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In alignment with the open and permissive spirit of the MIT License, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community an open, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

### Encouraged Behavior

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Contributing in ways that align with the project's permissive MIT license
* Respecting intellectual property rights while promoting open collaboration

### Unacceptable Behavior

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Adding license restrictions beyond those specified in the MIT License
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject:
* Comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct
* Contributors for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include:
* Using an official project e-mail address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## MIT License Alignment

This Code of Conduct is designed to promote the same principles of openness and collaboration that the MIT License embodies:
* The freedom to use, modify, and distribute
* The responsibility to preserve attribution
* The understanding that collaboration improves software

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from various open-source codes of conduct, aligned with MIT License principles, and crafted to promote both freedom and responsibility in open source development.
