## Day 0 - Planning Phase

### Scope

**Roadmap Process:**
- Our roadmap follows a "World" progression system, clearly mapping features to maturity levels
- Each World represents a major capability milestone with defined "Boss Fight" technical achievements
- Contributions are aligned with progression through maintainer levels
- Community feedback drives prioritization through GitHub discussions

**Target Personas:**
1. Platform Engineers - Managing cloud-native infrastructure
2. DevOps Engineers - Implementing automation and CI/CD
3. SRE Teams - Maintaining production systems
4. Development Teams - Building cloud-native applications

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Automated cloud-native operations using AI
- Intelligent monitoring and visualization
- Predictive scaling and resource optimization
- Natural language interfaces for cloud tools

**Additional Supported Use Cases:**
- Custom LLM training for specialized domains
- GitOps workflow automation
- Multi-cluster management
- Cost optimization through pay-per-query model

**Unsupported Use Cases:**
- On-premises only deployments without cloud connectivity
- Air-gapped environments
- Real-time processing requirements under 100ms
- Non-Kubernetes orchestration platforms

**Target Organizations:**
- Cloud-native software companies
- Enterprise platform teams

- Organizations transitioning to cloud-native architecture

### Usability

**Interaction Model:**
Our Helm-based deployment ensures simple interaction patterns:

```bash
# Basic installation
helm repo add kepimetheus https://kepimetheus.github.io/charts
helm install kepimetheus kepimetheus/kepimetheus

# Configuration customization
helm install kepimetheus kepimetheus/kepimetheus \
  --set aws.enabled=true \
  --set grafana.plugin.autoInstall=true \
  --namespace kepimetheus-system \
  --create-namespace
```

**User Experience:**
- Single command deployment through Helm
- Auto-configuration with sensible defaults
- Native Grafana integration for familiar monitoring
- Natural language interface for reduced complexity

**Production Integration:**
- Seamless integration with existing CNCF tools:
  * Kubernetes for orchestration
  * Prometheus for metrics
  * Grafana for visualization
  * AWS services for AI capabilities
